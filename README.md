# Project Gold: Personal Website with Astro

Welcome to **Project Gold**, a personal website built using the **Astro** framework. This site is designed to showcase papers and photos, while exploring creative and scientific themes. The project also features a quirky twist where each GitLab project is named using **science terms**, adding an extra layer of fun to the development process.
