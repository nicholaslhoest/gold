<h1> Good Morning </h1>

<p> I’m gonna be the Pirate King. </p>

<p>
This is my little corner of the internet, my own space. I spend my time managing projects, building something real, and chasing my idea of freedom, wherever that takes me.

	<li> Preferred programming language is Java.</li>
	<li> Animating in 2D is my hobby.</li>
	<li> I find birds amazing.</li>
	<li> Golf, basketball, and sailing are my happy places.</li>
	<li> Favorite meal is BBQ ribs with corn on the cob.</li>
	<li> Favorite movie is Forrest Gump.</li>
</ul>
