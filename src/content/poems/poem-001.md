I summon strength.
A pray to no god.
Grant me strength.
Grant me patience.

Please summon my courage.
I cast a spell to cure my sadness.
I cast a spell of never ending change.

A smile that never breaks.
An eye that never tears.
A nose that never grows.

A perfect human.
Once perfect i'll be happy.
Happy once perfect.

Happy once perfect.
Place these spells onto me to find me.
These spells will grant me strength.
Strength that is true.

A spell to hide my age.
These spells will heal me.
Happy once perfect.

Spells to transform my flesh.
The price is no cost.

My body can't handle all these spells.
Lies I say to myself.
Happy once perfect.

The spells will free me from sadness.
THis wy I will find love fo rme.
I will fortune for me.
I will be remebered.
I am beautiful. 
These spells will save me.
I need these spells.
Save me spells.

Happy once perfect.
